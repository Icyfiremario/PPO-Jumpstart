# PPO-Jumpstart

## About
This is a repo that provides the bare minimum to jumpstart a PPO project. It has the model setup with a simple Feed Forward Neural network for the actor and critic and a template for a custom environment using gymnasium

## How to use
* Clone the repo onto your computer and create a virtual environment using the venv_create.bat file [^1]
* Activate the virtual environment and install the required libraries from requirements.txt
* Make adjustments to the environment and model for your project
* Run main.py

## Footnotes
[^1]: I will create a file for Linux soon although the command should work on any system if it is just copied into a command line opened in the folder
